# 23-JavaScript-Number-Converter
JavaScript Roman Numeral Converter
Note: The solution in the Test.html file achieved the certification requirements.
I tried several solutions, all that were successful on my end, but did not satisfy the certification.
After an inspection of certification error codes, I determined the certification wanted specific ID names used, and wanted testing for a specific array.

The result of my efforts produced two solutions in this file.

The first, is a conversion of Roman Numeral Breakpoints 1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1.
--This solution can be used as a "flash card" to study roman numeral breakpoints.
-- The html(Bootstrap) and JavaScript are on separate files. (External JavaScript).

The second, is a calculator that will convert any Arabic number into a Roman Numeral.
-- The JavaScript code is written in the html file.
