JavaScript Roman Numeral Converter
Note: The solution in the Test.html file achieved the certification requirements.
I tried several solutions, all that were successful on my end, but did not satisfy the certification.
After an inspection of certification error codes, I determined the certification wanted specific ID names used, and wanted testing for a specific array.
The result is two solutions in this file.
The first, is a conversion of Roman Numeral Breakpoints 1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1.
--This solution can be used as a "flash card" to study roman numeral breakpoints.

The second, is a calculator that will convert any Arabic number into a Roman Numeral.
